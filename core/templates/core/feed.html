### 2. The Python View File

Now, you need to make the filters actually *work*. You'll modify the view function that renders `feed.html`.

This file is located at:
* `core/views.py`

#### What to add in `core/views.py`:

You need to find the view function for your feed (it might be named `feed`, `all_complaints`, `issue_list`, etc.). Inside that function, you'll:

1.  **Get** the filter values from the `request.GET` object.
2.  **Filter** your database query based on those values.
3.  **Pass** the list of available issue types to your template so the dropdown is populated automatically.

Here's an example of how that view function might look (assuming your model is named `Complaint`):

```python
# Inside core/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Complaint  # Make sure to import your model

def feed_view(request): # Or whatever your view function is named
    
    # --- 1. Get filter data from the URL ---
    selected_issue_type = request.GET.get('issue_type', '')
    selected_status = request.GET.get('status', '')

    # --- 2. Start with all complaints ---
    complaints = Complaint.objects.all().order_by('-created_at') # Get all, newest first

    # --- 3. Apply filters if they exist ---
    if selected_issue_type:
        complaints = complaints.filter(issue_type=selected_issue_type) # Adjust field name
        
    if selected_status:
        complaints = complaints.filter(status=selected_status) # Adjust field name

    # --- 4. Get unique issue types for the dropdown ---
    # (Assuming 'issue_type' is a field on your Complaint model)
    issue_types = Complaint.objects.values_list('issue_type', flat=True).distinct()
    
    # (Assuming 'status' is a field on your Complaint model)
    # If statuses are dynamic, you'd get them like this:
    # statuses = Complaint.objects.values_list('status', flat=True).distinct()
    # For this example, we'll assume statuses are fixed (Pending, Resolved...)

    context = {
        'complaints': complaints,
        'issue_types': issue_types,
        # 'statuses': statuses, # Uncomment if your statuses are dynamic
    }
    
    return render(request, 'core/feed.html', context)
